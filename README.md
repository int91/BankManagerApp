This project is a simple bank manager with the ability to add accounts to the bank for people that want an account. The account data is shown as "account name", "account balance", "name" (name of person), "age", and "gender".

I made this project because I wanted to make something to help create a better understanding and get practice with the SOLID Python Principles.

I tried my best to stay completely on track with the principles, there might be a few errors here and there in terms of the principles, but the code is readable and works just fine. Everything is easy to extend, make modular for the things that aren't as modular as others. The code as concise as I could get it (which I do need to improve, but that comes with experience). The project is spread apart into multiple files based on what they are handling / containing.

I learned how to work with and implement the SOLID Principles during my time with this project, which wasn't that long.
